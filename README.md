# Rust Web

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project is mainly used to develop some web applications in rust language, including back-end API and front-end page rendering

## Modules:

* covid_19: Back end API for nucleic acid personal registration and nucleic acid testing institutions
* covid_19_front_end: Front end page rendering of nucleic acid detection


## Contribution

So far, I have only developed the nucleic acid service API project for the new coronavirus. Later, I will develop more web projects related to the rust language. If you have any interest and ideas, please submit PR or contact me.

I have been working hard and are looking for various contributions. Look forward to your help!
