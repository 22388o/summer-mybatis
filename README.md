![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project is used to learn rust language from simple to deep, and then to strengthen learning in multiple projects. It is used to help novice and experienced developers. It mainly includes the following modules.

## Modules:

* basics: All basic concepts of Rust
* complex: Rust complex concepts
* example: Project example
* leetcode: algorithm
* microsoft: Rust tutorial launched by Microsoft
* web: Back-end web API written in rust language


## Buildingï¼š

```bash
$ cargo check 

$ cargo build 
```
Switch to each module and test through test, for example:
```bash
$ cd complex

$ cargo test 
```

## Contribution

I have been working hard and are looking for various contributions.

So far, I have been making a version modification, including supplementing the code in the rust concept module. There is little code in the
leetcode algorithm module, and I strive to keep it updated. I have been focusing on Web modules, writing back-end API interfaces in rust language, and then I will introduce `Vue.js` separates the front and back ends, calls the rust API to do some examples, and introduces `Electron` to write cross platform applications.

Look forward to your help!
